Data analysis of Airbnb bookings to explore pricing trends, availability patterns, host behavior, and customer reviews. Includes data cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis to provide insights for travelers, hosts, and Airbnb platform strategies.
# Airbnb Booking Analysis

## Project Overview
The rapid growth of Airbnb has generated a massive amount of booking data. This project analyzes Airbnb bookings to uncover patterns in **pricing, availability, host behavior, and customer reviews**. By exploring these insights, travelers, hosts, and the Airbnb platform can make **data-driven decisions** to optimize their strategies.

---

## Problem Statement
Analyzing Airbnb booking data helps identify:

- Popular locations and high-demand neighborhoods.
- Seasonal demand and pricing distribution.
- Customer reviews and preferences.
- Host behavior in managing multiple listings and availability.

This understanding supports **travelers** in choosing affordable stays, **hosts** in optimizing pricing and occupancy, and **Airbnb** in improving platform strategies.
